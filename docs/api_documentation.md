## API Endpoints

### POST /api/v1/chat/completions

This is the main endpoint for interacting with the MCP server. It accepts a JSON-RPC 2.0 request and returns a JSON-RPC 2.0 response.

#### `tools/list`

Returns a list of all available tools.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/list",
  "id": 1
}
```

**Response (200):**

Returns a JSON object containing a list of tool definitions.

#### `tools/call`

Calls a specific tool with the given arguments.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "<tool_name>",
    "arguments": { ... }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

**Response (200):**

Returns a JSON object containing the result of the tool call.

## Microservice Architecture

The MCP Server now operates with a microservice architecture. The main application acts as a gateway, routing tool calls to specialized microservices (e.g., ServiceNow, GLPI). These microservices are dynamically started and stopped as needed to optimize resource usage.

Tool calls are made via the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, where the gateway interprets the tool request and forwards it to the appropriate microservice.

## Server Base URL

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

In Docker, they are exposed on port 8000.
